## 🔧 TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### **1. Robust Data Extraction**
```python
def robust_financial_extractor(row, field_options, default_value=0):
    """Extract financial values with multiple fallback options"""
    # Handles currency symbols, null values, type conversion
    # Returns clean numeric data or safe defaults
```

### **2. Error-Proof Analytics**
```python  
def safe_get(dictionary, key, default=None):
    """Prevent NoneType errors with safe dictionary access"""
    # Eliminates 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' errors
```

### **3. Complete Schema Mapping**
```python
# Real column mapping from Excel
'isbn': row.get('ISBN', '')
'title': row.get('Book Title', '') 
'purchase_rate_per_unit': row.get('Purchase Rate per unit', 0)
'selling_rate_per_unit': row.get('Rate per Unit', 0)
# 37 columns fully mapped with proper field names
```

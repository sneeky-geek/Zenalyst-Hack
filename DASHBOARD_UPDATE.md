# Enhanced Dashboard Update

## Important Changes

The enhanced analytics dashboard has been updated to work without requiring the separate analytics API server. All enhanced components now work directly with the regular API server (port 5000) data.

## Changes Made:

1. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - All components now fetch data from the regular API server (port 5000)
   - No need to start the separate analytics API server (port 5001)
   - Better performance and fewer dependencies

2. **Modified Components**:
   - EnhancedKpiSummary: Uses regular API data
   - EnhancedTimeSeriesChart: Transforms regular API data for time series analysis 
   - OutlierDetectionCard: Implements basic outlier detection using regular API data
   - SegmentationAnalysisCard: Implements K-means clustering algorithm directly in the component
   - EnhancedTransactionTable: Works with regular API transaction data

3. **Startup Scripts**:
   - New `start_enhanced_dashboard.bat` and `start_enhanced_dashboard.sh` to start just MongoDB, regular API, and frontend

## How to Use:

1. Run the simplified startup script:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   start_enhanced_dashboard.bat
   
   # On Unix/Linux/Mac
   chmod +x start_enhanced_dashboard.sh
   ./start_enhanced_dashboard.sh
   ```

2. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000

3. Upload files or folders to see enhanced analytics in action

## Technical Details:

- Enhanced components now implement their own analytics logic:
  - Outlier detection uses z-score calculation on transaction amounts
  - Segmentation uses k-means clustering on vendor data
  - Time series analysis aggregates transaction data by date

This update ensures the dashboard works well without additional dependencies while still providing advanced analytics capabilities.
